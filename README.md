# CTI-Integration-Project

## Objective

The CTI Integration Project is aimed to set up and configure a threat intelligence feed to analyze current threats by using an Open Threat Exchange (OTX) known as AlienVault into the OpenCTI platform for analysis. By setting up the OpenCTI platform connected with AlienVault, I was able to understand the current threat landscape facing different sectors and governments. This threat feed contains various amounts of information such as the top vulnerabilities, indicators of compromise, malware, and reported incidents that are ongoing events. With this threat intelligence information, I'm able to further enrich my investigations and analysis capabilities.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of threat intelligence feeds and utilizing open threat exchanges.
- Learned how to configure my own CTI platform and connect it to Open Threat Exchanges via AlienVault and GitHub repositories.
- Analyze the current threat landscape of different industries and governments being affected by cyber threats.
- Dive deep into the top vulnerabilities and indicators of compromises to look after when performing investigative analysis of environment.
- Gain knowledge of the various threat actor groups and their tactics against different industries.
